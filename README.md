# Embedded software project
This is an embedded software project builded in PIC16F84A 04/P microcontroller using the PICKIT 3 programmer. This project use a 7 segments display to show a number for each combination of inputs. The program was built in assembly language using MPLAB X IDE and charged in the microcontroller with the help of PICKIT 3.
